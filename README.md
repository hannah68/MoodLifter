# MoodLifter
Moodlifter is an app that recommends appropriate content based on one's instantaneous mood.

## How does MoodLifter works?
When in a good mood, MoodLifter shows the user a random quote and lets the user note down how they feel in their daily journal. Besides, they can share their positive moment with other users in the MoodLifter Forum.
In case of low moods, depending on the selected feeling, MoodLifter uses the saved information provided by the user to remind them of ways that can improve how they feel. For instance, it suggests calling the favourite person as a potential remedy for one's low mood. 
Additionally, MoodLifter allows you to keep daily journals, and provides relevent articles, videos and motivational quotes.

## Future improvements
1. Currently, a user can select one feeling at a time. The future improvement would be the ability for user to select multiple feeling and provide relevent materials based on multiple feeling.
2. There should be an ability for user to save their favourite quotes, articles and videos in their profile page in order to read them or watch them later. Because of time limitaion, this feature is under progrees.
3. Another feature that needs to be added is tracking the user's mood. It means that, user would be able to see how their moods fluctuated during the week, at the end of each week.
4. At the moment users can't share their good mood with others. This feature is under construction as well.

## Limitations
- There are limited materials for suggesting to users. I didn't find an external API to use for materials.
